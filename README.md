# Real-Time-Vehicle-Classification-and-Counting-for-Urban-Traffic-Monitoring

This project demonstrates a real-time system for detecting, classifying, and counting vehicles in urban traffic using YOLOv11 and ByteTrack. It provides an efficient way to monitor traffic and support urban planning with accurate vehicle tracking.

## Features
- Detects and classifies vehicles into categories: car, motorcycle, bus, truck, and van.
- Tracks vehicles across video frames using ByteTrack.
- Counts vehicles crossing a defined line in the video.
- Generates an annotated video with bounding boxes, labels, and counts for visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **YOLOv11**: Advanced object detection model.
- **ByteTrack**: Multi-object tracking framework.
- **Supervision Library**: Used for annotations and processing.
